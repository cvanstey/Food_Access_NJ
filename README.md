# Food Access NJ

Analyzes food landscapes across New Jersey ZIP codes by comparing USDA Food Access Research Atlas methodologies against complementary spatial, demographic, and retailer datasets — evaluating food access, food deserts, and food swamps at the ZIP and tract level.

---

## Features

- Integrates USDA, Census, CDC PLACES, NJEDA, SNAP, WIC, and OpenStreetMap datasets
- Calculates nearest supermarket and food retailer distances
- Evaluates food access patterns aggregated to ZIP/ZCTA reporting units while preserving tract-level USDA comparisons where available
- Computes multiple Food Swamp metrics (RFEI, mRFEI, NJEDA)
- Generates ZIP-level vulnerability indices
- Produces reports and statistical analyses
- Interactive ZIP code lookup utility

## Hypothesis

**Working hypothesis:** New Jersey ZIP codes with higher concentrations of older adults experience significantly poorer food access, characterized by greater supermarket distance and lower availability of SNAP and WIC food retailers.

**Null hypothesis (H₀):** Food access characteristics do not differ based on the concentration of older adults within New Jersey ZIP codes.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [repo-url]
cd [repo-name]
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Set up a Census API key (optional, recommended)

A free Census API key removes rate limits on ACS data requests.

- Sign up: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
- Set it as an environment variable — do **not** hardcode it in the script:

```bash
export CENSUS_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

### 4. Download project data

The datasets required to reproduce this analysis are too large to store in GitHub. Download the data package from Google Drive:

**Download data package:**  
[Google Drive Data Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14_zmFgw-F0yEetg64rVz1eCSIC9dVMWp?usp=drive_link)

After downloading:

1. Extract the files.
2. Create a `data/` directory in the project root if it does not already exist.
3. Place all downloaded files directly inside the `data/` folder.

The expected project structure is:

> If `nj_zip_complete.csv` is missing, `01_load_data.py` will raise a `FileNotFoundError` and prompt you to run `nj_zip_crosswalk.py` to regenerate it. That script isn't part of this checklist since the generated file is included in the Drive download — but keep it in mind if you need to rebuild the crosswalk from scratch.

## Google Colab

A Google Colab notebook is provided for reproducible execution:

[Open in Google Colab]([COLAB_LINK](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MB6RLrqhqrNn8QonWsdPujrutfzU-swH?usp=sharing))

The notebook:
1. Clones this repository
2. Installs dependencies
3. Mounts the Google Drive data package
4. Runs the complete pipeline
---
## Running the Pipeline

Run the full pipeline with the orchestrator:

```bash
python src/run_pipeline.py
```

This runs every stage below in order and stops immediately if one fails, logging full output to `pipeline_logs/`. Resume from a failed stage with `python run_pipeline.py --from <stage_id>`, or run a single stage with `python run_pipeline.py --only <stage_id>`.

**Manual / individual stages**, if you need to run one by hand:

```bash
If nj_zip_complete.csv is missing, regenerate it by running:

python 00a_build_crosswalk.py
python 00b_enrich_crosswalk.py
python 01_load_data.py              # Data acquisition — downloads/reads all source datasets
python 02a_nearest.py               # Distance calculations (supermarkets, convenience stores, etc.)
python 02b_merge_sources.py         # Merges all cleaned sources into a single ZIP-level feature table
python 02c_clean_NJ_features_zip2.py    # Cleans nj_zip_features_v2.csv (dedup, sentinel values, type fixes) → nj_zip_features_v2_clean.csv
python 03_features.py               # Builds derived features and metrics
python 04_model.py                  # Statistical / ML modeling
python 05_reports.py                # Generates report outputs
python 06_analytics.py               # Core analysis
python 07_targeted_analysis.py      # Sub-population analysis (elderly ZIPs, per hypothesis)
python 08_zip_lookup.py             # Interactive ZIP-level lookup tool
```

`rename_columns.py` is not a standalone stage — it's imported directly by `02b_merge_sources.py` to rename ACS/PLACES columns before saving. `pipeline_utils.py` is likewise a shared module, not a stage.

*Note: `clean_NJ_features_zip2.py` isn't yet renamed to match the pipeline's numbered convention (e.g. `02c_clean_features.py`) — rename it and update `run_pipeline.py`'s `STAGES` list once you do.*
```

`01_load_data.py` performs data acquisition only — it downloads/reads all source datasets, prints a confirmation summary for each of its 10 sections, and writes cleaned intermediate files into `data/` for use by later steps: `acs_df.csv`, `places_df.csv`, `crosswalk_df.csv`, `wic_df.csv`, `snap_df.csv`, `fara_agg.csv`, `osm_counts.csv`, `njeda_communities.csv`.

### Expected output from `01_load_data.py`

| Dataset | Shape |
|---|---|
| OSM ZIPs | 535 ZIPs × 18 cols |
| OSM food locations | 37,818 elements |
| ZCTA boundaries (NJ) | 598 rows × 3 cols |
| County boundaries (NJ) | 21 rows × 18 cols |
| Census ACS estimates | 598 rows × 59 cols |
| CDC PLACES health data | 32,520 rows × 84 cols |
| ZIP → Municipality crosswalk | 598 rows × 36 cols |
| WIC authorized retailers | 889 rows (NJ only) |
| SNAP authorized retailers | 5,447 rows (NJ only) |
| NJEDA food desert communities | 25 communities |
| USDA FARA (tract-level) | 2,002 rows × 12 cols |
| USDA FARA (ZIP-aggregated) | 691 rows × 12 cols |

The script ends with an **out-of-state ZIP trace** — a diagnostic check confirming that border ZCTAs which geometrically touch NJ counties (e.g. `19153` in Philadelphia, `10977` in Spring Valley, NY) are correctly filtered out before reaching the final ZIP-level datasets. Seeing these ZIPs in early-stage debug output is expected; seeing them in final aggregated files would indicate a bug.

## Statistical Modeling

The project evaluates food access vulnerability using:

- Exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis
- Logistic regression classification
- Random Forest classification
- Gradient Boosting classification
- Leave-one-county-out spatial cross-validation
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for model evaluation

Model features include demographic, socioeconomic, transportation, and environmental variables while excluding proximity features used to define the target outcome to reduce leakage.
### Food Desert Methods

**USDA Food Access Research Atlas (FARA)**
This project implements the primary USDA ERS Low Income Low Access (LILA) measure using poverty and supermarket-distance thresholds. Official USDA FARA flags are also imported for comparison.

### Food Swamp Methods

**RFEI (Retail Food Environment Index)**
Ratio of unhealthy to healthy retailers, following Cooksey-Stowers (2017): `(fast_food + convenience) / (supermarket + grocery + produce_market)`. An extended variant (`rfei_full`) adds dollar stores to the numerator.

**mRFEI (Modified RFEI)**
CDC method measuring the percentage of healthy retailers among all food retailers: `(healthy / total) × 100`. A WIC-specific variant (`mrfei_wic`) substitutes WIC-certified vendors as the healthy retailer count.

**NJ Food Swamp Score**
Based on the NJ DCA / NJEDA methodology: ratio of nearest distance to a swamp outlet vs. nearest supermarket, scaled 0–100. A high score indicates the unhealthy option is spatially closer than the healthy one.

**4-Method Consensus Vote**
All four swamp methods are combined into a consensus flag (`is_swamp_consensus`) requiring agreement from at least 2 of 4 methods, with a continuous score (`swamp_score_continuous`) and method count (`swamp_method_count`) for transparency.

### Composite & Vulnerability Scores

**Composite Vulnerability Index** (`composite_vuln_index`) blends supermarket distance, RFEI, poverty rate, vehicle access, and elderly concentration using percentile-rank weighting. Note: this differs from the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps Food Environment Index, which uses a ranked-average method on a 0–10 scale, and from the NJEDA composite factor score, which uses iterated principal factor analysis with orthogonal varimax rotation across 24 neighborhood indicators — a full factor analysis implementation is a planned improvement.

**Sub-population Vulnerability Scores** — `novehicle_vuln_score` and `elderly_vuln_score` — apply similar percentile-rank weighting within those populations specifically.

**Rule-based Access Typology** classifies each ZIP into one of four categories: True Desert, Food Swamp, Food Mirage, or Dollar Store Desert.

### Implementation Notes

- `supermarkets_within_5mi` is currently a placeholder using ZIP-level store count; point-in-polygon spatial buffering is not yet implemented.
- GIS network analysis fields (`nearest_supermarket_miles`, `nearest_fastfood_miles`) use Euclidean distance, not routed network distance. Full network routing is planned for a future ArcGIS component.
- The Structural Determinants Model (multi-variable intersectional analysis of retail density vs. transit equity) is also deferred to the ArcGIS component.
- The FDC Programmatic Allocation Framework (NJEDA rank-ordered classification across 1,015 block groups) is referenced as a comparison target but not yet implemented.

### On OSM Classifications

OSM uses its own tagging taxonomy that does not map cleanly onto food access research definitions. Wawa is tagged `shop=convenience` in OSM (inflating the RFEI numerator), and small grocers are often tagged the same way (deflating the denominator). RFEI and mRFEI store counts therefore use SNAP/WIC data where available; OSM data is used primarily for spatial features (nearest-distance calculations) where it is more reliable.

## External / Live Data Sources

Pulled automatically by `01_load_data.py` at runtime — no manual download needed:

| Source | Dataset | Auth Required |
|---|---|---|
| OSM Overpass API | Food-related point locations (supermarkets, convenience stores, fast food, etc.) | No |
| Census TIGER | NJ county boundary shapefiles | No |
| Census ACS 5-Year API | ZCTA-level demographic estimates | Optional (recommended) |
| CDC PLACES (Socrata) | ZIP-level health outcome data | No |
| NJ DOH | WIC-authorized vendor PDF | No |

OSM results are cached locally to `data/osm_data.json` after the first run to avoid re-querying Overpass on subsequent runs. The initial Overpass call can take 30–120 seconds; subsequent runs using the cache are much faster.
